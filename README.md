I tried to code the hangman game but I got stucked with the key press event to be saved in a array and to change in the words
I am still behind and trying to catch up. 

In this javascript I save in an array all the letters and create function for each.

ps. I have been sick and working every day hope to make it up for next homework.

thanks
